# The-Portfolio
A quick template and walkthough for a minimalist portfolio website

### Getting Started
Go ahead and make a github repo - for testing to make sure it's set up correctly, make the name `yourname.github.io`. For example, I would use matthewcech.github.io as the name.

### Configuring GitHub's side of this:

- Head to repo settings
- Find the secion about github pages. If you have not enabled it, do so. 
- Once enabled, specify your custom domain. 
- If you look in the repo root, we see a CNAME file was added!
- It's good practice to add a www.<sitename> variant. You can do this in-browser by clicking the edit button.
